## Working with this project

### Development

The development liveserver can be launched with a typical `start` command:

```sh
$> yarn start
```

The liveserver will be available at http://localhost:8080/. It will automatically reload whenever it detects changes to the source files.

### Production

A production build of the site can be generated via `build`:

```sh
$> yarn run build
```

The built site files will be contained within the **dist/** folder.
